# JS-Functions

## Description
This site runs a few simple JS functions. 1 takes a function, addBand and passes the string which is the name of the band and prints an ordered list to the DOM in a DOM printing function. 2 takes an animal and converts it to a nugget. This is an exercise of input/output.
